# HTML Resume Assignment

In this assignment, you will create a resume website using HTML. The resume includes two pages:

- `index.html`: A semantically structured resume
- `contact.html`: A contact form with submission functionality

You will use the provided `resume.json` file as your source of content. This assignment is designed to help you practice HTML structure and prepare for a future React assignment that uses the same JSON data.

## Provided Files
