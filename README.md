# HTML Resume Assignment

In this assignment, you will create a resume website using HTML. The resume includes two pages:

- `index.html`: A semantically structured resume
- `contact.html`: A contact form with submission functionality

You will use the provided `resume.json` file as your source of content. This assignment is designed to help you practice HTML structure and prepare for a future React assignment that uses the same JSON data.

---

## Provided Files

- `resume.json`: A JSON template where you'll enter your name, education, experience, and other content.  This is the data that becomes the content of your resume.  ie. The tests will expect the data in resume.json to match the data in your html resume.
